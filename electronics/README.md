## Overview
As I am creating tutorials, I will try to include links to either
the product that I bought previously, or a similar product if the
original product is no longer for sale (some of the parts I have are many years old).

If you are just starting out, I'd recommend ordering this starter kit...
- [Amazon link](https://amzn.to/3IyKacg) Great starter kit : Boardboard + jumper wires + some starter components (LEDs, resistors, pots, transistors, capacitors, switches, 74959 IC, CdS sensor, buzzers, etc.)

**NOTE:** I own many other kits with various sensors that we will also be utilizing in future videos.  I'll add links to those kits as I use them in my YouTube videos.


## Parts list
### Breadboards
- [Amazon link](https://amzn.to/3IyKacg) Great starter kit : Boardboard + jumper wires + some starter components (LEDs, resistors, pots, transistors, capacitors, switches, 74959 IC, CdS sensor, buzzers, etc.)
- [Amazon link](https://amzn.to/3lRGRUM) Large breadboard, very similar to the one in my videos.  Great for prototyping LARGE circuits.
- [Amazon link](https://amzn.to/3IAEUoi) Variety of breadboards (2 with rails, 6 without) + jumper wires; very similar to other boards I own.

### Resistors
- [Amazon link](https://amzn.to/3Igs0uB) A good assortment of resistors.
- [Amazon link](https://amzn.to/3Kk6nvJ) I love how easy it is to read the values on this decade box (and I own two of these) but they are expensive.
- [Amazon link](https://amzn.to/3IeSHzw) This circuit board has variable resistors, moving the jumpers around is a little bit of a pain, but it's nice to be able to get a precise value vs. using a trimmer or potentiometer.

### LEDs
- [Amazon link](https://amzn.to/3XNYLER) This is one of my main assortment of LEDs.
