# FlipSignal

FlipSignal is a simple application still under development.  The goal is to create an application
that allows you to quickly send a signal using a FlipBoard.

## Installation
Make sure you have a RAW format .SUB file file named `Tesla_charge_AM270.sub` and `Tesla_charge_AM650.sub` in your `SD Card/subghz` folder or else pressing action 3 or 4 will crash!

Action 1 and 2 are hard coded to send 433MHz Princeton signals with different button values.  You can pair this to an outlet that supports Princeton.

Action 3 and 4 are hard coded to send Tesla signals with different modulation.  You can use this to send any two .SUB files that are in RAW format.
