# FlipSignal

FlipSignal is a simple application still under development.  The goal is to create an application
that allows you to quickly send a signal using a FlipBoard.

## Installation
Action 1 and 2 are hard coded to send 433MHz Princeton signals with different button values.  You can pair this to an outlet that supports Princeton.

Make sure you have a file named `Tesla_charge_AM270.sub` and `Tesla_charge_AM650.sub` in your `SD Card/subghz` folder or else pressing action 3 or 4 will crash!
