# Programming for Flipper with C

Tips and tricks for developing Application for Flipper using C Programming language I had to learn the hard way. While I am a professional programmer, C is not a language I'm well experienced with, so don't expect my findings to always be correct. This is meant to be a help for others like me trying to develop for Flipper devices, as it is hard to find useful documentation online. If you have something to correct or some good resources to link, let me know.
