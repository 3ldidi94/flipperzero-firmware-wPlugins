# Completed Steps of Simon Tutorial
Each step of the [Simon tutorial](../README.md) has a corresponding directory in this directory (up to step 7). Each directory contains the files that were created or modified in that step. For example, the `step-01` directory contains the files that were created or modified in step 1 of the tutorial. The `step-02` directory contains the files that were created or modified in step 2 of the tutorial, and so on.

It is recommended you follow the [Simon tutorial](../README.md) yourself and only use this as a reference.  If you have read and understood the first seven steps, feel free to copy the files from the `step-07` directory into your own project and continue from there. Don't forget to edit the `fap_author` and `fap_weburl` entries!
