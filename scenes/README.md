This README should have a more detailed explanation on the 3 files used to automate the scene FP arrays and enumeration.

- How can the user add additional scenes?
    - What files new are necessary and what modifications are necessary for existing files?

- Maybe an explanation of the use of ADD_SCENE(...) macro and example of what it produces?
