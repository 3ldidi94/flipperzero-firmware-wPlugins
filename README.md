# Introduction

![](screenshoots/scree_id_card.png)

This was an example application for a basic tutorial available on my [school blog](https://blog.gistre.epita.fr/).
I cloned [this repository](https://github.com/alanretgue/Flipper_Zero-app_tutorial) to keep the tutorial very simple and I will improve this project on this repository.

# Build and Run

If you don't have a good environment to flash this application, you can take a look to [the blog](https://blog.gistre.epita.fr/) where I explain how to setup this.
