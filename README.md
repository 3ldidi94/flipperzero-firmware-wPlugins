# flipper-zero-tutorials
I will use this repository for my Flipper Zero projects.  The various README.md files should describe how to use the files on your Flipper Zero.

Feel free to reach out to me at CodeAllNight@outlook.com with any questions or leave them in the [issues section](https://github.com/jamisonderek/flipper-zero-tutorials/issues) for this project.


## Firmware
### firmware-updating
[tutorial](./firmware/updating/README.md) - The Flipper Zero makes updating the firmware simple and fairly safe.  It is easy to build your own firmware as well using the fbt command.


## GPIO
### gpio-gpio-polling-demo
[tutorial](./gpio/gpio_polling_demo/README.md) - This is a "hello world" demonstration of reading a GPIO pin using polling.


## Subghz
### subghz-plugins-subghz_demo
[tutorial](./subghz/plugins/subghz_demo/README.md) - This is a demonstration of sending &amp; receiving radio signals using the subghz_tx_rx worker library.

### subghz-plugins-rock_paper_scissors
[game](./subghz/plugins/rock_paper_scissors/README.md) -
This is a two player game that uses the subghz_tx_rx worker library for communication.  Two Flipper Zeros running this game can play Rock, Paper, Scissors against each other!

### subghz-protocol-x10-decoder
[project](./subghz/protocols/x10/README.md) - This is a protocol decoder for the Flipper Zero to decode the x10 series of devices when doing a read from the Sub-GHz menu.

### subghz-samples-quantum-fire
[data](./subghz/samples/quantum-fire/README.md) - These Flipper Zero subghz captures are from the remote control for the Quantum Fire (QF-6LR).
