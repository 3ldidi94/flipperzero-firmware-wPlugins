**IMPORTANT**: This Flipper application currently only works on release 0.90.1 of the official firmware (at the time this repository was made, that is the latest). I provide NO support for earlier firmware or custom firmware, but this may change soon.

## What
This Flipper application ("FAP") spams broadcast packets to Apple devices, which may be up to 5 meters away.
