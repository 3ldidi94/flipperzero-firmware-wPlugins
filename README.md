# flipper-zero-tutorials
I will use this repository for my Flipper Zero projects.  The various README.md files should describe how to use the files on your Flipper Zero.

Feel free to reach out to me at CodeAllNight@outlook.com with any questions or leave them in the [issues section](https://github.com/jamisonderek/flipper-zero-tutorials/issues) for this project.


## firmware-updating
[tutorial](./firmware/updating/README.md) - The Flipper Zero makes updating the firmware simple and fairly safe.  It is easy to build your own firmware as well using the fbt command.

## subghz-protocol-x10-decoder
[project](./subghz/protocols/x10/README.md) - This is a protocol decoder for the Flipper Zero to decode the x10 series of devices when doing a read from the Sub-GHz menu.
