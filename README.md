# Flipper Mfkey32

This project is still in development. Do not try to build it yet, ETC: March 5th. We have it running in ~20 min/nonce and are working on an optimization that could possibly run it closer to ~2 min/nonce.

## Remaining TODO:
1. Complete testing optimizations
1. Use threads in FAP to update the screen with the cracking progress
1. Update FAP with pcequivalent.c struct/signedness fixes
1. Add the cracked keys back to the (top of the) Flipper user dict
