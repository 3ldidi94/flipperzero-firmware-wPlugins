# Pwnagotchi-Flipper interface
This program will interface the pwnagotchi with the flipper. This will be accomplished using custom code on the pwnagotchi's end to give the flipper simple rendering instructions over UART.

## Layout
This project is broken down into two parts: pwn_zero and TBD
```
pwnagotchi-flipper
 |--> pwn_zero/
 |--> TBD/
```
- pwn_zero is the Flipper-side application
- TBD is the pwnagotchi-side application

## Current state
FUNCTIONALITY IS CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT: IT IS INCOMPLETE!
As of commit 3cca697 (11/8/22) I have gotten a semi-working version of the protocol. It uses a double buffer system which allows editting of the screen's contents and then later drawing to the screen. This may or may not be the final system. Currently this has many internal issues that I will look into soon and try and fix up. I am on the home stretch to finishing the Flipper side of the interface!

## Setup
TODO: Explain setup process
NOTE: Interface is still being developed, when I have a working version I will explain the setup procedure.

## Development stages
### Stage 1: Simple display rendering
- Stage 1 will focus on getting the Pwnagotchi display to render on the Flipper's display

### Stage 2: App interaction
- Stage 2 will allow the user to interact and control the pwnagotchi using the Flipper's interface
