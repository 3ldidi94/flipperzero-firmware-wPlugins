## What Apps do I have here 

## Tools
- Cross Remote: An app to chain Infrared and SubGhz commands and run them with on click<br>

## Games
- Color Guess: For designers/webworkers. Guess the HEX value of the color shown on the LED light<br>

## Misc (Stuff I did to learn from)
- Orgamotron: Added new vibro modes to the app orginally developed by qqmajikpp<br>
- Ledpulser: Runs pulse animations on the LED light<br>

## How to install on Flipper Zero
- If you do not have one, download a firmware<br>
- Plug your Flipper Zero in via USB. <br>
- Copy the contents of the application folder into the applications_user folder of your firmware. <br> 

Then run the command: 
 ```
.\fbt launch_app APPSRC=applications_user/<application name>
 ```
The application will be compiled and copied onto your device.
