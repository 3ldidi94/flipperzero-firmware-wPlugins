# flipper-zero-tutorials
I will use this repository for my Flipper Zero projects.  The various README.md files should describe how to use the files on your Flipper Zero.

Feel free to reach out to me at CodeAllNight@outlook.com with any questions or leave them in the [issues section](https://github.com/jamisonderek/flipper-zero-tutorials/issues) for this project.


## YouTube
### videos
[video index](./youtube/README.md) - This is a list of my various YouTube video tutorials.


## Electronics
### electronics projects
[parts list](./electronics/README.md) - This is a list of electronics parts that I will be using in my videos or tutorials.


## Firmware
### firmware-updating
[tutorial](./firmware/updating/README.md) - The Flipper Zero makes updating the firmware simple and fairly safe.  It is easy to build your own firmware as well using the fbt command.


## GPIO
### gpio-pins
[tool](./gpio/pins/README.md) - This is a set of files you can copy to your Flipper Zero so that you can easily lookup the meaning of a pin.

### hc_sr04
[project](./gpio/hc_sr04/README.md) - This is an improvement over the original HC_SR04 library so that you can get mm accuracy in measurements.  It displays ultrasonic distance in both inches/cm.  The readme explains how the code gets more accurate timings.

### gpio-gpio-7segment
[project](./gpio/gpio_7segment/README.md) - This application can control a common-anode or common-cathode 7-segment display.  When you click the OK button the display shows a random dice roll (1-6); but you can modify code to display any number from 0-9.

### gpio-gpio-polling-demo
[tutorial](./gpio/gpio_polling_demo/README.md) - This is a "hello world" demonstration of reading a GPIO pin using polling.




## Subghz [folder](./subghz/README.md)
### subghz-plugins-subghz_demo
[tutorial](./subghz/plugins/subghz_demo/README.md) - This is a demonstration of sending &amp; receiving radio signals using the subghz_tx_rx worker library.

### subghz-plugins-rock_paper_scissors
[game](./subghz/plugins/rock_paper_scissors/README.md) -
This is a two player game that uses the subghz_tx_rx worker library for communication.  Two Flipper Zeros running this game can play Rock, Paper, Scissors against each other!

### subghz-protocol-x10-decoder
[project](./subghz/protocols/x10/README.md) - This is a protocol decoder for the Flipper Zero to decode the x10 series of devices when doing a read from the Sub-GHz menu.

### subghz-samples-chevy-hhr-2006
[data](./subghz/samples/chevy-hhr-2006/README.md) - These Flipper Zero subghz captures are from the remote control for the Chevy HHR 2006 keyfob.

### subghz-samples-quantum-fire
[data](./subghz/samples/quantum-fire/README.md) - These Flipper Zero subghz captures are from the remote control for the Quantum Fire (QF-6LR).

### subghz-samples-x10
[data](./subghz/samples/x10/README.md) - These Flipper Zero subghz captures are from the remote control for the X10.
