# Pwnagotchi-Flipper interface
This program will interface the pwnagotchi with the flipper. This will be accomplished using custom code on the pwnagotchi's end to give the flipper simple rendering instructions over UART.

## Layout
This project is broken down into two parts: pwn_zero and TBD
```
pwnagotchi-flipper
 |--> pwn_zero/
 |--> TBD/
```
- pwn_zero is the Flipper-side application
- TBD is the pwnagotchi-side application

## Setup
TODO: Explain setup process

## Development stages
### Stage 1: Simple display rendering
- Stage 1 will focus on getting the Pwnagotchi display to render on the Flipper's display

### Stage 2: App interaction
- Stage 2 will allow the user to interact and control the pwnagotchi using the Flipper's interface
